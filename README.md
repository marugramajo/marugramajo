<h3> I am a Full Stack Developer.</h3>

<h3>Finishing my degree in Psychopedagogy, I discovered almost by chance the world of programming, and I was fascinated by it. A world where the possibility of creating new and unique things is within the reach of a few lines of code, I find it incredible! Thus, with how wonderful learning is, I had the opportunity to train and be part of #Henry, where I learned to use technologies such as:</h3>

<h4>âš¡Programming language: JavaScript.</h4>
<h4>âš¡Web Technologies: NodeJS, Bootstrap, CSS, HTML.</h4>
<h4>âš¡Framework/ Libraries: ReactJS, Redux, Express.</h4>
<h4>âš¡Database: PostgreSQL, Sequelize.</h4>
<h4>âš¡Project Management: Trello, Slack.</h4>
<h4>âš¡Version control: Git, Github.</h4>
