 I am a Full Stack Developer.

Finishing my degree in Psychopedagogy, I discovered almost by chance the world of programming, and I was fascinated by it. A world where the possibility of creating new and unique things is within the reach of a few lines of code, I find it incredible! Thus, with how wonderful learning is, I had the opportunity to train and be part of #Henry, where I learned to use technologies such as:

<h3>âš¡Programming language: JavaScript.
âš¡Web Technologies: NodeJS, Bootstrap, CSS, HTML.
âš¡Framework/ Libraries: ReactJS, Redux, Express.
âš¡Database: PostgreSQL, Sequelize.
âš¡Project Management: Trello, Slack.
âš¡Version control: Git, Github.</h3>
